# NHL Predictor Game

A comprehensive guide for building an NHL game prediction application using Microsoft Power Platform components including Dataverse, Power Apps, and Gen Pages.

## Overview

This repository contains detailed documentation and guides for creating a modern NHL game predictor application that leverages the Microsoft Power Platform. The application will allow users to predict NHL game outcomes using historical data, team statistics, and machine learning capabilities.

## Architecture

The NHL Predictor Game is built using three core Microsoft Power Platform components:

- **Dataverse**: Stores NHL team data, player statistics, historical game results, and prediction data
- **Power Apps**: Provides the user interface for making predictions and viewing results
- **Gen Pages**: Enables AI-powered content generation for game insights and analysis
